# Battery_System_Design_Simulink
Designed and used characterization experiments to construct an accurate equivalent circuit for a specific battery cell, with parameters depending on environmental and operating conditions, as well as age. advanced state estimation techniques such as Kalman Filtering to determine state of charge using the characterization parameters.
